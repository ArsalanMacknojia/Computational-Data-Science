Q. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere.
A.
I cached the DataFrame after calculating the relative score. The upfront cost to generate the DataFrame is high and its been used multiple times in the program, hence,
not caching it will result in high execution time.

Q. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?
A. Marking DataFrames for broadcast resulted in a faster execution time.
Execution time with broadcast:
real 0m41.485s
user 0m26.880s
sys 0m1.688s

Execution time without broadcast:
real 0m45.394s
user 0m29.536s
sys 0m1.836s
