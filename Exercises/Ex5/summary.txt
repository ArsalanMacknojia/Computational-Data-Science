data-1: Values are linearly correlated, starting from (-22.6, -2.56), going up to (35.23, 27.38) with mean value of (8.71, 12.52).
data-2: Values are linearly correlated, starting from (-33.27, -18.62), going up to (27.64, 14.38) with mean value of (-0.71, -0.74).
data-3: Values are concentrated in 4 different groups around coordinates (-2, 7), (0, 8), (2, 9), (4, 10).
data-4: Values creates SFU logo with length 87.3 units on x-axis and height 44.5 units on y-axis.
data-5: Values creates 5 vertical lines of different heights each separated by around 20 units on x axis.
data-6: Values are linearly correlated with minimal noise, starting from (-24.33, -22.95), going up to (35.40, 36.07) with only two outliers.
