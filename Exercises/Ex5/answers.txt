Q.1 Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?
A. Transforming data by taking the square root (np.sqrt) was the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test.

Q.2 I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing.
Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.
A.
If we reject null hypothesis for original T-test, the conclusion would be the mean comment count for weekday and weekend is different.
If we reject null hypothesis for transformed data T-test, the conclusion would be the variance of weekday and weekend is different.

Q.3 Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?”
Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)
A. In my opinion, Mann–Whitney U-test did a better job without any transformation compared to other methods.

Q.4 When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?
A. Mean comment count for weekday and weekend suggest that there are more comments posted on weekdays.
