Q.1 When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice?
A. I think LOESS smoothing generated a better result compared to Kalman. I noticed LOESS was smoother than Kalman and I suspect its due to the assumptions made in Kalman's transition matrix.

Q.2 In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude?
A. We could have predicted next latitude and longitude using the course (direction) and distance travelled in the direction.
To calculate the distance we could have used speed and timestamp. (distance = speed * time)
