Q.1 In the A/B test analysis, do you feel like we're p-hacking? How comfortable are you coming to a conclusion at p < 0.05?
A. Yes, to a certain extent since we are only analysing a subset of data (instructor) to draw conclusion. Based on the analysis p-value is greater than 0.05.

Q.2 If we had done T-tests between each pair of sorting implementation results, how many tests would we run? If we looked for p < 0.05 in them, what would the probability be of having all conclusions correct, just by chance? That's the effective p-value of the many-T-tests analysis.
A.
We would have to run 21 tests. The probability of having all conclusions correct would be 0.95 ^ 21 => 0.3405616263

Q.3 Give a ranking of the sorting implementations by speed, including which ones could not be distinguished. (i.e. which pairs could our experiment not conclude had different running times?)
A.
Following is the ranking of the sorting implementation from fastest to slowest:
partition_sort, qs1, (qs2 and qs3), (qs4 and qs5), merge1

Sort implementation qs2 and qs3 are indistinguishable. Similarly, qs4 and qs5 are indistinguishable.
