Q.1 Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? 
Which code do you think is easier to read?

A. 
Calculations to find the city with the lowest precipitation, average precipitation in each month and average precipitation in each city were quite similar. 
I found both the libraries easy to work with due to extensive documentation available online. In terms of readability, I found Pandas code a bit easier to read.

Q.2 What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?

A. 
pivot_months_loops runtime: 778 ms ± 34.7 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
pivot_months_pandas runtime: 34.5 ms ± 1.21 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

pivot_months_pandas runtime is 22x faster compared to pivot_months_loops which uses standard python data structures such as sets and dictionaries along with a for loop to iterate over data.
The difference is due to Pandas' DataFrame which is an efficient data structure designed specifically for data science and analytics. It does high-performance vectorized calculations using highly optimized C code to avoid Python level loops. It also exhibits strong temporal and spatial locality which results in great performance using techniques such as caching, prefetching, and advance branch predictors.
