Q.1 Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value? Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?
A.Residuals are not normally distributed. Values are left skewed so we cannot look at the OLS p-value unless we do some data transformation.
Since we can't reject the null hypothesis, we cannot conclude that the ratings are increasing.

Q.2 Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise?
A. Yes, the new prediction is definitely allowing Kalman filter to do a better job. However, the overall filtering doesn't improve much because with increase in data there is an increase in noise as well.
